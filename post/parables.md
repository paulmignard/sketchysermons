I illustrated a great message from Wilson Community Church down in North Carolina. Pastor Jonathan Minter was actually my boss way back in the day when I got my first development job and was instrumental in me starting this sketchy sermons journey. Definitely a recommended message because I thought I knew the parable of the lost son pretty well and there are key aspects I totally missed. A timely message for the gate keeping culture we sometimes find ourselves in!
