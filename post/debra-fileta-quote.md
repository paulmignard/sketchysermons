I couldn’t agree with this more. I don’t think any conflict in my life has been made better by waiting for the “right time” and that’s most true in my marriage. It’s like a water leak or a knock in the engine; get in the right mindset and start working on it until it’s fixed. Conflict is not the enemy; apathy is the enemy. Ephesians 4:25-32
