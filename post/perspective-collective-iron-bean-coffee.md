Scotty always brings the fire with theÂ [@perspectivepodcast](https://www.instagram.com/perspectivepodcast/)but this one is special to me. In episode 157 he spoke with Fred and Chanell Dedrick; founders of theÂ [@ironbeancoffeecompany](https://www.instagram.com/ironbeancoffeecompany/)Â and it is SO GOOD. Thereâ€™s a lot of stuff in there about entrepreneurship and following your dreams and all that but what really stood out to me was the relationship. Thereâ€™s something special in seeing a marriage play out like God intended itâ€™s to be. Itâ€™s obvious theyâ€™re a team. The way they speak to other and interact you can really tell itâ€™s them against the world and theyâ€™ve got each otherâ€™s back no matter what. That and they exude so much energy itâ€™s contagious!Â   
My wife and I are in a similar position. Married over twenty years, former military, running a small business together, and we got each otherâ€™s back through it all. I couldnâ€™t do much of anything without her!Â   
Do yourself a favor and check it out! ðŸ”¥
