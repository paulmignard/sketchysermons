“A faith that is tested is a faith that is trusted.”

Worship leader extraordinaire Scott Bullman took the reigns at TRBC this last Sunday to continue the Good News for Hard Times series. This series is a little difficult to illustrate because there is SO MUCH CONTENT. The handout they gave us had 4 pages of notes just for this sermon. I tried to distill it down as much as possible without losing the meaning!

In other news, I think next week I’m going to add some white space to the sketch note. This one is pretty busy and a lot of lines are filler and not details which I’m not too crazy about. Plus it’s been a while since I snuck an octopus into my notes. 😅
