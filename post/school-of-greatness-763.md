Man, I know I’m late on this one but I found this podcast by [@lewishowes](https://www.instagram.com/lewishowes/) (I now have ~100 episodes queued 😬) and his interview with [@erwinmcmanus](https://www.instagram.com/erwinmcmanus/) and it is total 🔥🔥🔥. This quote is a singular moment in a stream of quotes about God, Jesus, the broken-hearted, and the desires we all have that Jesus placed in us. I thought his word choice was excellent here because he didn’t say “the life we’ve always WANTED.” What we want and what we ultimately long for are not always in line with each other. Check out this episode, I’m sure it’ll encourage you as it has encouraged me!
