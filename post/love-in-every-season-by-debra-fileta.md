I love being married. It’s seriously the great adventure of my life and it keeps getting better and better. Like all rewarding things in life though it’s not something that just happens; I gotta keep sharpening the axe. In saying that “Love in Every Season” by [Debra Fileta](https://www.instagram.com/truelovedates/?hl=en) is a fantastic (and biblical) exploration into the different phases people can find themselves in from time to time. It’s a quick read that is highly entertaining and provides a great framework to view your relationship through. If you happen to be at a bookstore at least flip through it and read the gray highlights; you’ll find something that speaks to you! Check it out!
