Sermons like the one Scott Bullman preached this weekend at TRBC always stick with me because the idea of angels out there walking among us is interesting, comforting, and terrifying all at the same time. I’ve been thinking about them ever since the sermon. I remember Charles preaching a sermon about them a couple of years ago, I didn’t digitally sketch that one so I may need to dig it up and redo it!

Anyway, God bless your week!
