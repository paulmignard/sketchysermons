When Charles Billingsley gives a sermon, he definitely leaves you with a couple of things to think about along with some great facts and stories. This Sunday at Thomas Road Baptist Church was no exception. This note was a little difficult because there was SO MUCH that I had to cut and I already I feel like there's a lot of inside information that you might not get if you haven't seen it but I definitely recommend checking it out, this one is all about HOPE!
