I’m not trying to be dark; stay with me for a second….

The last sermon I sketch noted had me looking up Ezekiels prophecy and I just found the language around it so interesting. Ezekiel 37 is a vision about being placed in a valley of dry bones and how the Lord commands Ezekiel to prophecy to the bones to make them live again. The vision is explained to be the restoring of the Israelites to their land but the vision cast is super-grim and at the same time, super epic.

Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up and our hope has perished. We are completely cut off.’ Therefore prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God, “Behold, I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves, My people. I will put My Spirit within you and you will come to life, and I will place you on your own land. Then you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken and done it,” declares the Lord.’”
 
The imagery of the Old Testament can be so grand.
