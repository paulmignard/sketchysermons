This was a commission for my brother-in-law Rick Ouimet, pastor of Mosaic Church here in Lynchburg. Itâ€™s a summation of his most often used (and beloved) catch phrases! His wonderful wife wanted to surprise him with it for his birthday and I appreciated being a part of it. You could probably string together an entire sermon series off of these phrases alone! ðŸ˜… Happy Birthday!
