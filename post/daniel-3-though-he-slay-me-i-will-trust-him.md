There were a lot of notes to take at [Thomas Road Baptist Church](https://www.facebook.com/ThomasRoad/?__tn__=KH-R&eid=ARCuRBDLm1XabU9r9FWcEIgu6NckEgdl9q25TY_JfHsgLsOnwGq5Pirqp30qWqAqWD7TjOd6XeuJm2nZ&fref=mentions&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARA-ySdmmThA2ipl4DNH9prbyNQpuQGFBXeKC4jZU7hA88ggbxTzk8A6APSCQJ9bO6yDrad0xSsEruaeC9WpXuJzTchmQpA78ApTGo0hRva_Tism2mRTFaEu2QhILpgfItVE5JP5iH5KgzQ9QuR3-hWMydOzY45Sy_58HWzeJzZjbiK_tXLVzIx5-N0NVjwegc_d8WhN6eZfnkSUqaN57HO9Z-myzBVFeyWbJXqDzRtpo0hCR5h0198BqcZLxZU2_xKg3LAMNIIU179sVQb1z3BoHjCzVpxSLyhEeAaQ0JxEhwkPuvM5yJWsCsIZxmEmeq6gSa0okgVucIpHOZg) this week including one of the more hardcore verses in the Old Testament (Daniel 3:18.) Pastor Jonathan spoke of having an “Insane Faith” and how we should never compromise our faith for popularity considering the price these people were willing to pay. 

I thought about making this one a two page spread but I’m not sure how it would work. I don’t think I’m done with this sermon yet; it’s one of those that sticks with you for a while.
