[Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com) wrote Steal Like an Artist which sits prominently on my tiny bookshelf next to The War of Art; it’s so good. Keep Going is a book written in the same vein, it’s easy to read, highly motivational and tactical, and gives you something new and actionable each time you read it. I really have no complaints about it. If you you’re an artist (you are) and you create (you do) I would highly recommend picking this book up TODAY.
