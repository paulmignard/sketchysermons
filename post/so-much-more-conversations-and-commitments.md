It was another packed message on Sunday at Thomas Road Baptist Church! I always check the sermon notes before the message starts to see what I’m getting into (Thomas Road is the only church I’ve found that publishes their notes ahead of time which is MUCH APPRECIATED) and looking at these notes I found myself wondering “how is Pastor Jonathan going to cover all of this in just 30 minutes?” He did, it was insightful and challenging, and he said my new favorite quote “God doesn’t want to just hear from you when you’re thanking him for a hot dog!” Definitely a triumph in word selection because if he would have said “meal” or “sandwich” I don’t think it would have stuck but choosing to say hot dog made the statement ridiculous and poignant at the same time. I was blessed by this sermon and hope you are too! Don’t be surprised if you see the hot dog quote illustrated later this week...🤷‍♂️🌭
