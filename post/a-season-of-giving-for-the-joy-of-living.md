I can’t imagine how hard it is for a pastor to preach a sermon about giving; I think Pastor Jonathan did a good job at [Thomas Road Baptist Church](https://www.facebook.com/ThomasRoad/?__tn__=KH-R&eid=ARC3b5qfsqfNTywBveB25uLP-Bc_ipkjttap-ADn_0q-V5L4t86nqq6MH1-CGGsxu5b__nH0J3OzEvBz&fref=mentions&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARB3RhhUWIWeL6bYBcFwHq4IuRVweJ-rhjDtXhUyQRNebbqD12OfwvkP40QEfpF1oki7B8cYX1nUFWe7DSmAMj_HqG61nRs71zVrw-VcuFRCfRo1VaTZBYQoXYsJ-NuoBL97hOflfCKWhiOEoFD-p1vRNC27CLXztgXH3o90FN4iqJhOtH4q6yUcrQ-rfWkZYAg6m6mCCJDEmUfNZlDGX82E7B3498NXUn87C_A_ZrJhYTF34jfkkDdEPx2iJRaw3rtM3gq8RmIv0c3xeNzbCN37dCIVdHJDaxDn5rd1HqdSm9wQ2SyuzToTnY4c1j6k0Myxt7JrEXI50J9FWGk) of balancing that line pretty well and also calling out some of the huckster-style tactics that we see from “pastors” on those late night infomercial type things. Giving shouldn’t be about guilt and it definitely shouldn’t be about reward. If done properly, people shouldn’t even really know that you gave at all.
