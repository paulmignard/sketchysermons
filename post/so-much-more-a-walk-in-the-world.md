Charles Billingsley preached at Thomas Road Baptist Church on Sunday and brought the ðŸ”¥! The sermon was great, loaded with exposition and motivation. This is the first in a series of spiritual disciplines that will be preached about over the next month. Sermons like this can be difficult for me because I start writing down every single sentence. Having to trim and decide what to actually post is a real struggle; Itâ€™s all so good!

Iâ€™m really looking forward to the rest of this series!
