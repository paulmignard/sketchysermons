If you would have asked me yesterday what a “Fugazi” was I would have responded “Oh that’s a punk band from the 90’s.” Not anymore! Always learning, always learning…

I headed back over to @waymaker.church (online) to catch the next sermon in their Seasons of the Soul series and it continues to be revelatory. There’s a lot of content so it’s a little hard to capture it all here but the message of being open to removing things in your life that is holding you back from God’s greater purpose is a timely one. Pastor @jondupin doesn’t pull a lot of punches so you may end up questioning some things in your life; get ready. Also, the baptisms that happened afterwards are super inspirational!

I’m probably going to finish out the series so I thought about experimenting with making them all connect when printed out. I did this back for the Easter series for TRBC but haven’t done it with a sermon series so it’ll be a new adventure for all of us. 😅
