Pastor Jonathan spoke of hypocrisy and how to be an example on Sunday and what a powerful message it is. Christians in particular will have the light of truth pointed at them at one time or another and it’s vitally important that what we say and what we do match. I know so many times it’s easy to look like the world; we allow everything to be permissible and end up in the same predicaments that we actively preach against. We can do better. Like Pastor Jonathan said; we’ve been given a gift. What are we doing with it?
