This was a special one - Julie and I were married at Central Christian Church in Las Vegas waaaay back in the day when the church was on Pecos. It was great to go back but it was a totally new experience. The coffee shop inside was unreal. The my picture of Pastor Wilhite looks _nothing_ like him. ðŸ¤ª
