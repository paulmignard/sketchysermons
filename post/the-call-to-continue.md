I don’t know if Jonathan has ever said it but I imagine the “Jesus First’ pin that he always wears on his lapel belonged to his dad; I try to make sure it’s on there every time I draw him!

I really appreciated the sermon this morning, not only is there a great promise in Jesus’ message but also a great challenge!
