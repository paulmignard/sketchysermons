Ok, this one needs some context.

If you’re not familiar with [@preachersnsneakers](https://www.instagram.com/preachersnsneakers/) , it’s an account that features pastors and other Christian leaders wearing really expensive clothes. Did I mention it’s controversial? It’s controversial. “Tyler” the anonymous person that runs the account has a genuine heart and an excellent podcast. On this episode, [@unwrinkling](https://www.instagram.com/unwrinkling/) spoke at length about our relation as believers to the world of fashion and our responsibility to try and reduce the amount of exploitation and general waste that our buying purchases create. There’s so much good stuff there and my inarticulate explanation is doing more harm than good so just go listen to it and I’m sure you’ll walk away with at least few things to think about! 😅
