There's a lot in this video that has nothing to do with road rage and everything with what Dr. John defines as two truths:

1. We are not the center of the universe.
2. There is very little we actually control.

Wow. This is a source of empathy for me. We interact with people on a daily basis and so little of what we experience has anything to actually do with us. Being cut off in traffic, having someone cut in line, or experiencing rudeness in almost any situation has to do with someone elses state of mind and virtually nothing to do with who we are or what we are doing. It makes us feel small and it almost feels like it demands a reaction. But like Dr. John instructs here and like the Bible instructs us in numerous verses (most notably in James 1:19) we should be slow to anger. Be empathetic. Just let it go. We can be right or we can choose to just enjoy our life. Show God's righteousness. Be known by your love.

It's amazing how quickly a situation can change just by changing our minds.
