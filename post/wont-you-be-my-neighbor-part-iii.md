Coach Thomas Mullins was the guest speaker at TRBC this weekend and there was so much good stuff it was hard to whittle down my notes to just the few things I documented here. There were great stories about the collaboration between Thomas Road and his church down in Florida in helping out in the Bahamas which was awesome to hear. If you’re a sucker for an uplifting message with a sports theme I’d highly recommend heading over to the website and checking this one out!
