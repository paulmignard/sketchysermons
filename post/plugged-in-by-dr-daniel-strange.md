This was a pretty interesting quote from “Plugged In” by Dr. Daniel Strange. The chapter was speaking to what kind of culture we as Christians should allow into our homes. Rather than provide a typical response (“watch this but not that”) he posed this statement which changes the question from “what should I allow” to “what should I create?” Love this!
