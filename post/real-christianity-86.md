How can I know I am born again? ðŸ˜³

Whenever I offer to sketchnote a sermon for a pastor I find that they never give me a boring sermon to sketchnote. They are usually the rough ones and this one from Dale Partridge at @relearnhq is no exception. I listened to this video on YouTube quite a few times over and while Iâ€™ve heard the story of Nicodemus from John 3 many many times Iâ€™ve never heard it from this perspective. He really brings to life the confusion that Nicodemus felt and the confusion we feel when we address this topic from a Biblical perspective and not a moralism perspective.

Iâ€™ve condensed down a pretty deep message here so I highly recommend checking out the sermon to get full clarity. ðŸ™Œ
