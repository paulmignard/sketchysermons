I was invited to sketch note a sermon for [@res\_church](https://www.instagram.com/res_church/) in Aurora, IL and here are my notes!

As a Christ-follower, I am not a “burn in hell” guy - far from it. I feel like the topic of hell and the way it’s used to either scare or punish others is contemptible at best and could be damaging in many cases. But it is something that is a core subject of Christianity and needs to be addressed. I thought Pastor James did a great of addressing the topic with compassion and reverence and discussing not only what hell is but what our response to it should be.
