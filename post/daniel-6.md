There‚Äôs a lot to talk about!

First - yesterday‚Äôs message at¬†[Thomas Road Baptist Church](https://www.facebook.com/ThomasRoad/?__tn__=KH-R&eid=ARDn4PGbrpwYuzfvnQxalsVhGFnYswFpvBkcag0NkfTZSU8ttHRBXI-QlRSfhP3pOFKkDVDyzC3KKk3y&fref=mentions&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBlvHhCaD9LQprNhNhOL-scCXbxoVMAi1cEWksYfk4mTP8q3Dq5Y56PAEEaRaeFhIx1KbutXeyY0g6yvG8u2axtRiz7g2wxCMyF5zyukhsKFDAW2KmtJ0m668NtHuS2q0QkkngnTnuMr-YCY-3HYiWPx1yiHwMDYI2tssym1C3lcymWimZBnngqN7r8zUrLAc1TDXV1FMwla6t6x9tjvMsxh-40iHkXj8HYstLcZ0gaavx6BYj8kyumVDdKPu_65fxdg3r6QmkSZAzTrIRSxFXX8kpEJTtdPN6FlXXrf68prpqe1OCJ-dX1eJIGDeWSG0NNLwS1eidzX27NmnQ)¬†was great! I think any Daniel sermon series would end in the lion‚Äôs den and in a weird way I was dreading it because drawing fur is not my strong suit. I initially had more lions in the scene but it was becoming a mess so I trimmed it. Anyway, it‚Äôs so true that ‚ÄúDoing the right thing will make you a target!‚Äù If you missed it, I‚Äôd highly recommend checking it out.‚Ä®‚Ä®

Second - I have the last two sermon notes by Charles but I kinda tried making them connect into one big sermon note and it‚Äôs been more work than I thought. Also, I have perfectionist tendencies so it‚Äôs not done yet. I‚Äôll post it up this week when it's ready!

Third - I have some more plans for the sketchy sermon site; at the moment it‚Äôs kinda neglected but with the changes Instagram is making and the ‚Äúpay for play‚Äù incentive model of social media I‚Äôm wanting to make the website more of a hub for this stuff and just use social media to announce updates and changes but not have them live on social media alone. We‚Äôll see how it goes.

Are you still reading? Wow, high-five for you!!¬†üôå
