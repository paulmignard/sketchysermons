Ok, today’s sermon by Ben Gutierrez was kinda tricky for me. I think I’ve gotten used to Pastor Jonathan’s sermon style so when someone else speaks it takes me a second to get a feel for where it’s going. I don’t think I really got it until I redrew it tonight but I tried to get as close to Gutierrez’ original message as possible. Anyway, Jesus raised a man from the dead - believe that!
