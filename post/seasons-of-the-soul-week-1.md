If you're ever back on Hooper Road in Lynchburg, VA there is a section where the trees open up to the most amazing view and that's where Waymaker Church is. I caught the latest sermon and it's fantastic; there was almost too much to take notes on. I tried to capture the highlights but there was a whole section on "mastering the season" that I completely left out. I love how the natural concept of "seasons" almost perfectly overlays on our pattern of experiences. It's similar to the book "Love in Every Season" that I sketched out a month or so ago. I feel like Sofia did a terrific job of drawing out what it means to be in the summer season and what our response should ultimately be as a believer in that season.

I continue to marvel that the reach of any small town church is now virtually unlimited. So awesome! ðŸ™Œ If you have a chance I highly recommend checking them out.
