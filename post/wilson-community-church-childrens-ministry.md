I had the pleasure of being commissioned to make some GIANT stickers for the hallway of the new kids ministry wing for Wilson Community Church. An old boss and friend set up the narrative and after handling my many delays (still sorry about that üò¨) they were able to get them installed for the grand opening!

It was a fantastic experience and I‚Äôd highly recommend going the sticker route! Not only are they reproducible but I couldn‚Äôt imagine how long they would have taken if I was hand-painting them! Here‚Äôs the full set:

The other part of this project was a huge timeline connecting all of the murals; I won‚Äôt post them all but here‚Äôs what they looked like:

It was a great project with some great memories. I hope it‚Äôs useful to them for years to come! üôåüèª
