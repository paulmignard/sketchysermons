From birth I was cast on you; from my mother’s womb you have been my God. Psalm 22:10

Back to waymaker; this time for Winter. This one was heart-wrenching. The end game is beautiful in that we get to witness God’s restorative power but getting there is hard. Psalm 22 lived out and on display this week. If you are looking for encouragement in your marriage and an example of the powerful grace that God provides then I’d highly recommend checking this service out.

Also, I can’t help but mention [Debra Fileta's](https://truelovedates.com/) “Love in Every Season.” This book details the different seasons we go through specifically in relationships and marriages and details the strategies to thrive through each one. It’s an interesting look at the cycles we go through and what to expect when we encounter each one.
