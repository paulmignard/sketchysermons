My wife and I really enjoyed the message and the whole service at [@powersourceva](https://www.instagram.com/powersourceva/) ; the middle school ministry at [@thomasroad](https://www.instagram.com/thomasroad/). It’s a simple message. If more people could recognize when they’re taking direction from their emotions and not thinking clearly, I could see a world with less regret and unintended consequences. One of my favorite quotes that I couldn’t fit in the drawing is “The church should be the safest place to talk about real issues.” I couldn’t agree more pastor Jeremy! We were blessed in knowing our son was being ministered to in an environment full of people that you can tell have a heart for kids. Thanks Powersource!
