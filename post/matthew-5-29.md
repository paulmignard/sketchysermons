I know I know…Jesus was being hyperbolic when he said this. He didn’t expect a legion of Christians to gouge out their eyes to prevent themselves from sinning. Why I drew this though (besides the interesting imagery) is because I’m impacted by Jesus’ message of personal responsibility here. Almost everything he speaks about in the Sermon on the Mount is about us taking responsibility for our actions, our feelings, and the not-obvious ways we are supposed to react to strife and adversity. It’s a poetic and prescriptive solution to many of the problems we face. You may or may not be able to change the situation - but you can always change yourself.
