I’ve been experimenting with [@adobedrawing](https://www.instagram.com/adobedrawing/)and fresco to see if I can make some decent vector drawings on the iPad. Overall not bad. The vector brushes seem similar (maybe they’re the same?) as the illustrator draw brushes so there’s some clean up that would need to happen before printing. Does anybody have a vector drawing app for iPad they absolutely adore?
