Finding Your Artistic Voice by [@lisacongdon](https://www.instagram.com/lisacongdon/) ! This book was generously given to me by the super awesome [@prspctv\_cllctv](https://www.instagram.com/prspctv_cllctv/) and I tore through it pretty quickly. Letting go of perfectionism keeps coming up over and over again in the books that I’m reading so it’s nice to know I’m not the only one who struggles with this sort of thing! There were a lot more notes but I had to make room for the tigers so if you want to know more you’ll need to pick up the book. Thanks so much Scotty!!!
